    <h1><strong>Work In progress</strong></h1>
    <p>Based off of our current solution, there is only 1 way to do this quickly: Make a copy of each JS file, and modify them to behave how they should for sandbox mode.</p>
    <p>It should go without saying, but that would be terrible design.</p>
    <p>The other option involves a slight reorganization of our current repo. Long story short, every class needs to be modularized, and a new file would need to be created
      to run p5js main functions like setup() and draw().
    </p>
    <p>Thus, a different main file would be imported for sandbox mode. The Game object may need to be different as well, but that is still manageable.</p>

    <p>May be best anyways, since we might want to get rid of all this Flask stuff.</p>
